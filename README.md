# Notes on Adobe Air

The purpose of this repository is to keep a record of my research and experimentation
on developing applications that run in Adobe AIR.

The _hello_ project is currently under construction (75% complete).

I am in the process of converting scripts to ant build files.

## Captive AIR runtime

From [Adobe's roadmap whitepaper](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplatform/whitepapers/roadmap.html):

> Adobe AIR 3 added the ability to package and distribute a captive AIR runtime 
> with the AIR distributable file. 
> This allows the application to run independent of any version of Adobe AIR 
> that may be installed on the system. 
> __Adobe recommends that all AIR content be distributed using a captive runtime,__ 
> and not rely on an AIR runtime being installed in order for the application to run.

NOTE: use of captive AIR runtime is the only way to get an AIR application to run on iOS.

ALSO NOTE: AIR install through Chrome has not worked for over a year; see the footnotes
in the criticism section in [
Adobe Integrated Runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime).

CONCLUSION: I will focus on developing a project that uses captive AIR runtime packaging.
