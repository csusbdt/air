# Notes on Adobe Air

The purpose of this repository is to keep a record of my research and experimentation
on developing applications that run in Adobe AIR.

My current project is to develop a process to develop an application using only text
editor and command line tools with the following features.

- Says _hello_ in a window -- that's all it does.
- Runs in OS X and Windows desktop environments.
- Installs and updates from a website.

This project is in the folder named _hello_.
