# Captive AIR Runtime Experiment

These are the beginnings of my notes on setting up a project
that relies on captive runtime distribution.

Captive AIR runtime distribution is required for iOS because iOS does
not support the shared runtime model needed otherwise; see 
[Installation and deployment options in Adobe AIR 3](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/air3-install-and-deployment-options.html).

To troubleshoot installation problems on mac, I had to look at the following log file.

    /private/var/log/system.log
